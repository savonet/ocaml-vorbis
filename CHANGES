* Allow any tag.

0.6.2 (03-08-2015)
=====
* Switched to Bytes and uppercast_ascii APIs.
* Changed types to match new ocaml-ogg's API.

  headerout functions.

0.6.0 (04-07-2011)

* Fixed segfault when finalizing a file decoder.
* Only encode or decode an array with the same number of 
  channels that the encoder/decoder requires.

  the exceptions defined in this module.
* Register previous function with Printexc.register_printer
  when available (ocaml >= 3.11.2)

* Added NO_CUSTOM to build 
  in standard mode.
* Added prefix to main compilation variables
  if passed to configure.
* Makefile now honnors LIBDIRS
  variable for linking against libraries
  located in other places than then standard
  ones.

0.5.0 (17-02-2009)
====
* Binded low-level decoding API
  in order to decode ogg streams.
  Previous Decoder module has been
  moved to File.Decoder
* Added time_of_granulepos to get the 
  relative time corresponding to a granulepos. 

0.4.1 (16-04-2008)
=====
* Minor fixes
* More portable make invokation
* Install .cmx file

0.4.0 (16-10-2007)
=====
* Complete rewrite of the library in order to use ocaml-ogg.

0.3.1 (20-05-2007)
=====
* Added decode_float to decode directly to float arrays.
* Added encode_float to encode directly from float arrays.
* Made the output format optional for function creating decoders since it is
  not used for float output.

0.3.0 (02-03-2007)
=====
* Changed duration value from int to float for more precision.
  It is an interface change, hence the new version number.
* Polishing and minor memory related fixes.

0.2.3 (11-11-2006)
=====
* More releases of ocaml's master lock.
* Fine-tuning of CAMLparams, cleaning up.

0.2.2 (07-07-2006)
=====
* Added set_charset function.
* Added blocking section in functions to open files.
* Optional information reading, avoids the computation of the file duration.
* Support for the "comment" metadata field.
* Code hardening, cleanup and documentation.

0.2.1 (15-11-2005)
=====
* Using caml_alloc_custom to create custom blocks.
* Added open_dec_file function to handle decoding of streams using callback
  functions.
* Added encode_buffer_part function to encode only a portion of a buffer.
* Added get_dec_file_bitstream, get_dec_file_comments and get_dec_file_info
  functions.
* Removed some unused fields in dec_params (sorry for the breakage of
  interface).
* Fixed some memory leaks with tags.

0.2.0 (20-04-2005)
=====
* Better conversion of the input audio data: downsampling supported, conversion
  from stereo to mono doesn't segfaults anymore. Added a blocking_section by the
  way, and a few inline.
* Reverted removal of open_dec_fd.
* Updated OCamlMakefile and improved build system.
* Using caml namespace functions.
* Added wav2ogg encoder example.

0.1.1 (30-06-2004)
=====
* Cleanup of the stubs with better use of the CAML* macros
* Prototype of "create_encoder" changed.
* "get_header_frame" is removed (replaced by the new create_encoder).
* Added "encoder_reset".
* Removed "enc_serial_number" parameter (it is randomly generated by "create_encoder").
* Removed "open_dec_fd" since it is not necessary and fdopen(2) is not ANSI C.
* Improved the mli documentation.

0.1.0 (05-02-2004)
=====
* Initial release.
