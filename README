make install


Usage
=====
Here are the typical workflows.

Encoding
--------
1. Vorbis.Encoder.create / Vorbis.Encoder.create_vbr: create an encoder
2. Ogg.Stream.create: create an ogg stream
3. Vorbis.Encoder.headerout: output the ogg header
4. Ogg.Stream.flush: flush the ogg stream to ensure that the header will be on
   its own page
5. Vorbis.Encoder.encode_buffer_float: encode data
6. Ogg.Stream.pagesout: get the resulting ogg pages
7. goto 5
8. Vorbis.Encoder.end_of_stream: indicate that it is the end of the stream
9. Ogg.Stream.pagesout: get the last pages
